Date: Sunday 15th September

A very wet day, but wind too, which is necessary when visiting the Singing Ringing Tree.

Geophone recordings (see [Orllewin geophone](../../../shop/Orllewin%20geophone.md)), noisy and short; recorded with the old Zoom H1 which had a tiny residue of charge available before turning off repeatedly. The battery kept cutting out before I could tweak the gain from the iRig2.

A (surprisingly decent) recording from my phone microphone:
