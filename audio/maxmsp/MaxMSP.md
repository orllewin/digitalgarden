## Part 1

Learning MaxMSP with the aim of making an ambient looper picking random length subsamples from a buffer and playing at various pitches/rates:

1. [Basic pitch and reverb](buffer_loops/Basic%20pitch%20and%20reverb.md) - first patch
2. [Basic pitch and reverb file](buffer_loops/Basic%20pitch%20and%20reverb%20file.md) - with ability to record output
3. [Basic buffer loop](buffer_loops/Basic%20buffer%20loop.md) - drag selection on a waveform to loop
4. [Basic buffer loop rate](buffer_loops/Basic%20buffer%20loop%20rate.md) - setting rate of a buffer loop using `play~` with logic added to hide any clicks at bad loop points. Includes a second implementation using `groove~`
5. [Random subsample looper](buffer_loops/Random%20subsample%20looper.md) - a full patch using all of the above and more
6. [Infiniverb](buffer_loops/Infiniverb.md) - creating a reusable component
7. [Live input buffer looper](buffer_loops/Live%20input%20buffer%20looper.md) - all of the above, but on a live 10 second input buffer

## Part 2

Live effects, hopefully for a guitar pedal using [RNBW](https://rnbo.cycling74.com).
