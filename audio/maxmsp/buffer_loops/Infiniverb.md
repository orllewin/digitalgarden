I just watched [Building an Infinite Reverb from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcG8v9wKxA) by [Astrobear Music](https://www.youtube.com/@astrobearmusic1977). They kindly include the reverb patch which I've modified to work with inlets to integrate with patches more easily (remember: I have no idea what I'm doing):

Add a left and right audio signal and some controls to set the dampening (20 to 20000) and feedback (0.0 to 1.0):

I've added 'infiniverb' to yesterdays [Random subsample looper](Random%20subsample%20looper.md):
