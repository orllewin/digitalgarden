I had a go at learning [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and made some quick progress:

Too much effort required at work again, so no frequent updates here. I have resurrected my old [Radio](../computers/software/Radio.md) Android project, rewriting it with the newer media3 libraries. This is preparation for some new work R&D coming up but it's also good to dust off that old project.

Somehow March came and went without an update.

I've been learning [MaxMSP](../audio/maxmsp/MaxMSP.md) which was always mysterious and complicated when I looked at it in the past, there's really nothing to it and it's lots of fun. I've been having a much needed break from Playdate dev (which has annoyed some users). I've sold a few [Orllewin geophones](../shop/Orllewin%20geophone.md) and am enjoying improving my soldering skills. I've also made a little microphone: [Orllewin tinyfone](../audio/hardware/Orllewin%20tinyfone.md).

I've added a lot of the old [Coracle](../computers/software/Coracle.md) demos to the Obsidian Vault using iFrames, you can view them by navigating on the left `graphics > coracle`. There's all sorts in there, [Tails and orbs](../computers/graphics/coracle/Tails%20and%20orbs.md) being a favourite.

Work is busy with a big release so that's been occupying a lot of brain cycles leaving little time or energy for other projects, plus we're attempting to move house, again.
