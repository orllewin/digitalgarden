## About

Enables sending midi note values to the Playdate over USB via an intermediary computer. It's a proof-of-concept project but very usable if you're a little technical. See also [Serial Comms](Serial%20Comms.md).

## Note. deprecated

Playdate now has [serialMessageReceived(msg)](https://sdk.play.date/2.5.0/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-serialMessageReceived) which makes this kind of thing much simpler.
