## About

This is/was a standalone app that contained the RawTherapee film simulation LUTs (converted from HaldCLUT to 256x16 format using [ÖppenHald](ÖppenHald.md)). It was a companion app to [Lento](Lento.md) and could send LUTs to it via custom Intents. The idea being even though this project [contained lots of brand names and trademarked film names](https://github.com/orllewin/lut_film_simulation_package/tree/main/app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi), Lento itself was trademark free.
